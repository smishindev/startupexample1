## 📋 PREVIOUS UPDATE - November 27, 2025

### Real-time Notifications Frontend Integration - PHASE 1 COMPLETE

**Socket.io real-time notifications implemented** - Replaced 30-second polling with instant real-time updates

#### Problem Solved
- ❌ **Old Behavior**: NotificationBell used 30-second polling (setInterval) → delayed notifications → poor UX
- ✅ **New Behavior**: Socket.io connection → instant notification delivery → toast alerts for urgent items → <1 second latency

#### Implementation Details

**1. Socket Connection Lifecycle**
- ✅ Socket connects on NotificationBell mount
- ✅ JWT authentication via socket.handshake.auth.token
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on unmount (disconnect)
- ✅ Graceful fallback if socket fails (initial REST fetch still works)

**2. Real-time Notification Listener**
- ✅ `socketService.onNotification()` registered
- ✅ New notifications prepended to state instantly
- ✅ Unread count increments in real-time
- ✅ Toast notifications for urgent/high priority:
  - `toast.warning()` for urgent/high (5s duration)
  - `toast.info()` for normal/low (3s duration)
- ✅ Action buttons in toasts (navigate to ActionUrl)

**3. Notification-Read Sync**
- ✅ `socketService.onNotificationRead()` listener
- ✅ Marks notifications read across all user devices/tabs
- ✅ Updates local state when notification read elsewhere

**4. Polling Removed**
- ✅ Removed `setInterval(fetchNotifications, 30000)`
- ✅ Kept initial fetch for historical notifications on mount
- ✅ All new notifications arrive via Socket.io

**5. Toast Notification System**
- ✅ Installed sonner library (`npm install sonner`)
- ✅ Added `<Toaster />` component to App.tsx (top-right position)
- ✅ Rich colors, close button, action support
- ✅ Auto-dismiss after duration

#### Files Modified (3 files)

**Frontend - Real-time Integration**
1. `client/src/components/Notifications/NotificationBell.tsx` - Added socket connection, listeners, toast notifications
2. `client/src/App.tsx` - Added Toaster component for toast display
3. `client/package.json` - Added sonner dependency

**Documentation - Architecture & Planning**
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Added comprehensive Socket.io integration section with flows
5. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Updated NEXT PRIORITIES with implementation plan reference
6. `REALTIME_FEATURES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Complete 3-phase implementation guide

socket.userId = decoded.userId
socket.join(`user-${userId}`)
  ↓
onNotification listener registered
  ↓
Backend NotificationService.createNotification()
  ↓
io.to(`user-${userId}`).emit('notification', data)
  ↓
Frontend receives notification
  ↓
State updated + Toast shown + Sound (optional)
```

**Notification Event Data**:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  type: string;
  priority: 'urgent' | 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  actionUrl?: string;

## 🎭 USER SCENARIOS & ACCESS CONTROL - November 22, 2025

### Complete User Role & Access Matrix

The platform supports multiple user roles and scenarios, each with specific permissions and behaviors:

#### **1. Student Scenarios**

**1.1 Student - Course Not Purchased**
- ✅ Can browse course catalog and view course details
- ✅ Can see course preview content (description, instructor, curriculum)
- ❌ Cannot access lesson content (videos, materials, assessments)
- ✅ Sees "Purchase Course" button with pricing
- ✅ Can proceed to checkout flow
- **Progress Tracking**: None (no enrollment)

**1.2 Student - Course Purchased/Enrolled**
- ✅ Full access to all course content (lessons, videos, assessments)
- ✅ Progress tracking active (lesson completion, video position, quiz scores)
- ✅ Video progress auto-saved every 5 seconds
- ✅ Lesson completion tracking with CompletedAt timestamps
- ✅ Can mark lessons as complete
- ✅ Sees progress indicators and completion badges
- ✅ Course progress contributes to analytics and certificates
- **Progress Tracking**: Full tracking enabled
- **UI Elements**: Progress bars, completion chips, "Mark Complete" button

#### **2. Instructor Scenarios**

**2.1 Instructor - Viewing Own Course/Lessons (Preview Mode)**
- ✅ Full access to all course content (no purchase required)
- ✅ Sees "Preview Mode" badge indicator (warning color)
- ❌ No progress tracking (views don't count in analytics)
- ❌ Video progress not saved (always starts at 0:00)
- ❌ Cannot mark lessons as complete
- ❌ No completion status displayed
- ❌ Lesson progress indicators hidden
- ✅ Can navigate between lessons freely
- ✅ Sees "Manage Course" button instead of "Purchase Course"
- **Purpose**: Quality assurance, content review, updates verification
- **Progress Tracking**: Completely disabled to prevent analytics contamination
- **UI Elements**: "Preview Mode" chip, disabled completion buttons, no progress bars

**2.2 Instructor - Viewing Another Instructor's Course (Not Enrolled)**
- ✅ Same as "Student - Course Not Purchased"
- ✅ Can browse and view course details
- ❌ Cannot access lesson content without purchase
- ✅ Sees "Purchase Course" button
- **Progress Tracking**: None

**2.3 Instructor - Enrolled as Student in Another Instructor's Course**
- ✅ Same as "Student - Course Purchased/Enrolled"
- ✅ Full progress tracking as a student
- ✅ Can mark lessons complete
- ✅ Video progress saved
- ✅ Course completion contributes to their student analytics
- **Progress Tracking**: Full tracking enabled
- **Note**: Instructors can also be students - roles are independent

#### **3. Admin Scenarios**

**3.1 Admin - Full Access**
- ✅ Access to all courses regardless of enrollment
- ✅ Can view all instructor dashboards
- ✅ Can manage users, courses, and content
- ✅ Analytics access across all courses
- **Progress Tracking**: Configurable (typically disabled for admin reviews)

### Access Control Implementation

**Backend Checks**:
- `enrollmentStatus.isInstructor` - Detects if user owns the course
- `enrollmentStatus.isEnrolled` - Detects if user purchased the course
- `req.user.role` - User's role (student/instructor/admin)

**Frontend Behavior**:
- `isInstructorPreview` flag - Disables progress tracking and completion features
- Conditional rendering based on enrollment status
- Role-based UI component visibility

### Key UX Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Instructor preview ≠ Student learning experience
2. **Analytics Integrity**: Instructor views must not contaminate student analytics
3. **Quality Assurance**: Instructors need to verify content without side effects
4. **Dual Roles**: Users can be both instructors and students simultaneously
5. **Clear Indicators**: Visual badges show preview mode vs learning mode

### Technical Implementation Files

- `LessonDetailPage.tsx` - Preview mode detection and UI adjustments
- `CourseDetailPage.tsx` - Button rendering based on enrollment status
- `progressApi.ts` - Progress tracking API (skipped for instructors)
- `videoProgressApi.ts` - Video position saving (disabled for preview)
- `coursesApi.getEnrollmentStatus()` - Returns isInstructor and isEnrolled flags

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - November 15, 2025

### Database Schema Integrity Protocol

**BEFORE removing any database column references from queries:**

1. ✅ **Check column usage across entire codebase** - Use grep_search to find ALL references
2. ✅ **Verify if column is a FEATURE or a BUG** - Check backend routes for intentional usage
3. ✅ **Search frontend for column usage** - Column might be used in UI components
4. ✅ **Review database schema documentation** - Check `database/schema.sql` for column definition
5. ⚠️ **ASSUMPTION**: If column appears in 30+ places = IT'S A FEATURE, not a bug
6. ⚠️ **DEFAULT ACTION**: Add missing column to database, don't break existing functionality

**Recent Example - IsPreview Column Incident (November 15, 2025):**
- ❌ **Wrong Approach**: Attempted to remove `IsPreview` references from queries (would break preview mode feature)
- ✅ **Correct Approach**: Added missing `IsPreview` column to AssessmentSubmissions table
- **Impact**: IsPreview used in 33 backend files + 12 frontend files = core feature for instructor preview mode
- **Lesson**: Always investigate before removing - user's challenge prevented breaking production feature

**Database Column Addition Checklist:**
1. Check if column exists: `sqlcmd -Q "SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TableName'"`
2. Review schema.sql for column definition
3. Create migration script in `database/add_[column_name]_column.sql`
4. Execute migration with proper error handling
5. Verify column added successfully
6. Update schema.sql documentation if needed

## 🔥 LATEST UPDATE - November 22, 2025

### Instructor Preview Mode & User Scenarios Documentation

**Complete role-based access control and UX improvements** - Comprehensive user scenarios documented and instructor preview mode refined

#### User Scenarios Matrix Documented
Added complete user role and access control documentation covering all platform scenarios:
- ✅ Student viewing unpurchased courses
- ✅ Student viewing purchased courses with full progress tracking
- ✅ Instructor viewing own courses (Preview Mode)
- ✅ Instructor viewing other instructors' courses
- ✅ Instructor enrolled as student in other courses
- ✅ Admin full access scenarios

#### Instructor Preview Mode Design Decisions

**Question**: Should instructors see completion status and be able to mark lessons complete when previewing their own courses?

**Answer**: **NO** - Instructor preview mode should be completely isolated from student learning experience.

**Rationale**:
1. **Analytics Integrity**: Instructor actions should not contaminate student analytics
2. **Quality Assurance Purpose**: Preview is for content verification, not learning
3. **Clear Mental Model**: Preview ≠ Learning (different contexts)
4. **No Side Effects**: Instructors reviewing content shouldn't create database records
5. **Professional Tool**: Similar to "preview mode" in CMS systems (WordPress, etc.)

**Instructor Preview Mode Features**:
- ❌ No lesson completion tracking
- ❌ No "Mark Complete" button visible
- ❌ No completion status displayed (no green checkmarks in lesson list)
- ❌ No video progress saved
- ❌ No course progress updates
- ✅ "Preview Mode" warning badge displayed
- ✅ Full content access for review
- ✅ Free navigation between lessons
- ✅ Video starts at 0:00 every time

**Student Learning Mode Features** (when instructor is enrolled as student in another course):
- ✅ Full progress tracking
- ✅ "Mark Complete" button visible
- ✅ Completion status displayed
- ✅ Video progress saved
- ✅ Course completion contributes to analytics

#### UI/UX Improvements Implemented

**1. Course Level Display on Instructor Dashboard**
- ✅ Added Level field to instructor courses backend query
- ✅ Color-coded level chips on course cards:
  - 🟢 Beginner (Green)
  - 🟠 Intermediate (Orange)
  - 🔴 Advanced (Red)

**2. Lesson List Completion Status**
- ✅ CheckCircle (green) - Completed lessons
- ✅ PlayCircleOutline (blue) - Current lesson
- ✅ RadioButtonUnchecked (gray) - Incomplete lessons
- ✅ Secondary text shows "Completed", "Current", or duration
- ✅ Completion status pulled from progress.lessonProgress.CompletedAt

**3. Preview Mode UI Adjustments**
- ✅ "Preview Mode" badge displayed prominently
- ✅ Progress indicators hidden for instructors
- ✅ "Mark Complete" button hidden in preview mode
- ✅ Lesson completion status not shown in preview mode

#### Files Modified (5 files)

**Backend**
1. `server/src/routes/instructor.ts` - Added Level field to courses query and GROUP BY

**Frontend - Services**
2. `client/src/services/instructorApi.ts` - Added level property to InstructorCourse interface

**Frontend - Pages**
3. `client/src/pages/Instructor/InstructorDashboard.tsx` - Added level Chip with color coding to course cards
4. `client/src/pages/Course/LessonDetailPage.tsx` - Updated lesson list to show completion status with proper icons

**Documentation**
5. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Added comprehensive user scenarios and access control matrix

#### Design Principles Established

**Role Separation**:
- Instructors wear two hats: content creator (preview mode) and learner (enrolled as student)
- These roles must remain completely separate in the system
- Preview mode = read-only content verification tool
- Student mode = full interactive learning experience

**Analytics Integrity**:
- Only actual student learning activity should appear in analytics
- Instructor content reviews should leave no trace
- Prevents inflated completion rates and skewed metrics

**Clear Visual Indicators**:
- "Preview Mode" badge clearly distinguishes modes
- Different UI elements shown based on user role
- No confusion between preview and learning contexts

### Database Recreation & SQL Login Management

**Critical Issue Resolved** - Database user recreation process documented and automated

#### Problem Identified
When dropping and recreating the database from `schema.sql`, only tables are created - the SQL Server login and database user (`mishin_learn_user`) are lost, causing connection failures on server startup.

#### Solution Implemented
1. ✅ **Updated schema.sql**: Added payment system tables (Transactions, Invoices) to main schema
2. ✅ **Database User Recreation Script**: Created automated user setup process
3. ✅ **Documentation**: Added DATABASE_RECREATION_GUIDE.md with step-by-step instructions

#### Database Recreation Process (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY)
```powershell
# 1. Drop and recreate database
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -Q "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS [startUp1]; CREATE DATABASE [startUp1];"

# 2. Execute schema to create all tables
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -i "database\schema.sql"

# 3. CREATE SQL LOGIN (if not exists)
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -Q "IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.server_principals WHERE name = 'mishin_learn_user') CREATE LOGIN [mishin_learn_user] WITH PASSWORD = 'MishinLearn2024!';"

# 4. CREATE DATABASE USER (if not exists)
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -Q "USE [startUp1]; IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = 'mishin_learn_user') CREATE USER [mishin_learn_user] FOR LOGIN [mishin_learn_user]; ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER [mishin_learn_user];"

# 5. Verify connection
npm run dev  # Should connect successfully
```

#### Files Modified
1. `database/schema.sql` - UPDATED: Added Transactions, Invoices, payment fields to Users table
2. `database/create_db_user.sql` - NEW: Automated user creation script
3. `DATABASE_RECREATION_GUIDE.md` - NEW: Step-by-step recreation guide

#### Why This Happens
- **SQL Server Logins**: Stored at server level (master database)
- **Database Users**: Stored per-database
- **Schema.sql**: Only creates tables, NOT logins/users
- **Result**: Fresh database has no user permissions

#### Prevention
- Always run user creation script after dropping database
- Never rely on schema.sql alone for complete setup
- Use automated script to prevent human error

## 📋 PREVIOUS UPDATE - November 5, 2025

### Upload Progress Enhancement with Beautiful UI & Animations

**Complete UX overhaul of file upload flow** - Professional progress tracking with visual feedback and smooth transitions

#### Problem Solved
- ❌ **Old Behavior**: Parallel uploads (Promise.all) → no progress visibility → instant completion → user confusion
- ✅ **New Behavior**: Sequential uploads → real-time progress tracking → animated status transitions → professional UX

#### Implementation Details

1. **Sequential Upload Processing** (`client/src/pages/Instructor/CourseCreationForm.tsx`)
   - ✅ Changed from `Promise.all()` to `for loop` for sequential file uploads
   - ✅ Uploads one file at a time with live progress updates
   - ✅ Prevents network congestion and provides accurate progress tracking
   - ✅ Total file count calculated upfront: `lessons.reduce()` counting pending video/transcript files

2. **Upload Progress State Management**
   - ✅ Added comprehensive state object with 10 properties:
     - `isOpen: boolean` - Controls dialog visibility
     - `current: number` - Current file number being uploaded
     - `total: number` - Total files to upload
     - `currentFileName: string` - Name of file being uploaded
     - `currentFileProgress: number` - Percentage (0-100) of current file
     - `status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'error'` - Current stage
     - `errorMessage?: string` - Error description if upload fails
     - `failedUploads: Array<...>` - List of failed uploads with details
     - `onComplete?: () => void` - Callback for completion (removed - auto-flow instead)
   - ✅ State updates per-file using `onProgress` callback from `fileUploadApi.uploadFile()`

3. **Upload Progress Dialog with 4 States**

   **State 1: Uploading (📤 Uploading Files)**
   - Shows "Uploading X of Y files"
   - Displays current file name
   - LinearProgress bar with live percentage
   - Warning: "Please don't close this window while files are uploading"
   - Red "Cancel Upload" button

   **State 2: Upload Complete (✓ Upload Complete)** - 1.5 seconds
   - ✅ Large green CheckCircle icon (80px) with Zoom animation
   - Bold text: "All Files Uploaded Successfully!"
   - Shows total file count
   - No buttons - auto-transitions to processing

   **State 3: Processing (⚙️ Creating Course)**
   - 🔄 CircularProgress spinner (60px) with Fade animation
   - Bold text: "Creating Your Course"
   - Subtitle: "Setting up lessons and publishing..."
   - No buttons - auto-completes

   **State 4: Error (⚠ Upload Errors)**
   - Red Alert with error message
   - List of failed uploads with lesson title, file name, error details
   - Gray "Close" button
   - Blue "Retry Failed Uploads" button (restarts publishCourse)

4. **Enhanced Visual Design**
   - ✅ Added MUI imports: `CircularProgress`, `Fade`, `Zoom`, `CheckCircleIcon`
   - ✅ Title icons: 📤 (uploading), ✓ (complete), ⚙️ (processing), ⚠ (error)
   - ✅ Centered layouts with proper spacing (`py: 3`)
   - ✅ Typography hierarchy: h6 for titles, body2 for subtitles
   - ✅ Color coding: success.main (green), error (red), text.secondary (gray)
   - ✅ Smooth transitions between states

5. **Error Handling & Retry**
   - ✅ Distinguishes critical (video) vs optional (transcript) failures
   - ✅ Video upload failure → stops process, shows error dialog
   - ✅ Transcript upload failure → logs error, continues (optional field)
   - ✅ Failed uploads tracked in array with: `{ lessonTitle, fileName, error, lessonIndex }`
   - ✅ Retry button re-invokes `publishCourse()` with fresh state

6. **Cancel Upload Functionality**
   - ✅ Added `cancelUpload: boolean` state flag
   - ✅ Checked between each file upload in the loop
   - ✅ Throws error and exits gracefully if user cancels
   - ✅ Resets `saving` state and closes dialog

7. **Automatic Flow (No Manual Close)**
   - ✅ Upload completes → Shows success for 1.5s → Auto-transitions to processing
   - ✅ Processing shown while `instructorApi.createCourse()` executes
   - ✅ Course created → Dialog closes → Auto-navigates to dashboard
   - ✅ Removed "Close" button from completed state (removed `onComplete` callback)
   - ✅ Seamless user experience with no interruptions

#### Applied to Both Functions
- ✅ `saveDraft()` - Creates unpublished course with uploads
- ✅ `publishCourse()` - Creates and publishes course with uploads
- ✅ Identical upload logic in both functions

#### Architecture Benefits
- ✅ **Professional UX**: Beautiful animations and clear visual feedback
- ✅ **Progress Visibility**: Users see exactly what's happening
- ✅ **Sequential Upload**: One file at a time prevents network overload
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanism for failed uploads
- ✅ **User Control**: Cancel button during uploads
- ✅ **Smooth Flow**: Automatic transitions between states
- ✅ **No Confusion**: Clear status at every stage

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Backend running on port 3001
- ✅ Frontend running on port 5173
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Upload flow tested with multiple videos
- ✅ All transitions working smoothly
- ✅ Auto-navigation to dashboard confirmed

## 🔥 PREVIOUS UPDATE - November 4, 2025

### Deferred File Upload Architecture Implementation

**Complete refactoring to prevent orphaned files** - Files no longer uploaded until course/lesson is published

#### Problem Solved
- ❌ **Old Behavior**: Files uploaded immediately on selection → saved to server/DB even if user cancels → orphaned files accumulate
- ✅ **New Behavior**: Files stored locally in memory → preview shown → uploaded only when user publishes course → no orphans on cancel

#### Implementation Details

1. **FileUpload Component Enhancement** (`client/src/components/Upload/FileUpload.tsx`)
   - ✅ Added `forwardRef` with `useImperativeHandle` to expose upload method
   - ✅ New interface: `FileUploadHandle` with `uploadPendingFile()` and `getPendingFile()` methods
   - ✅ Added props: `deferUpload?: boolean`, `onFileSelected?: (file: File | null) => void`
   - ✅ Added state: `pendingFile: File | null`, `previewUrl: string | null`
   - ✅ Modified `handleFileSelect()`: If `deferUpload={true}`, stores file locally instead of uploading
   - ✅ Preview rendering: Shows video player or image preview with file info and "Will be uploaded when you publish" message
   - ✅ Cleanup: `URL.revokeObjectURL()` in useEffect to prevent memory leaks

2. **CourseCreationForm Updates** (`client/src/pages/Instructor/CourseCreationForm.tsx`)
   - ✅ Imported `FileUploadHandle` and `fileUploadApi`
   - ✅ Added `pendingVideoFile` and `pendingTranscriptFile` to `Lesson` interface
   - ✅ Added refs: `videoFileUploadRef`, `transcriptFileUploadRef` (shared for dialog, works because modal)
   - ✅ Added callbacks: `handleVideoFileSelected`, `handleTranscriptFileSelected`
   - ✅ Updated FileUpload components with `deferUpload={true}`, `ref={videoFileUploadRef}`, `onFileSelected={handleVideoFileSelected}`
   - ✅ Modified `saveDraft()` and `publishCourse()`:
     - Upload all pending files using `fileUploadApi.uploadFile()` with `Promise.all()`
     - Sequential processing per lesson (video first, then transcript)
     - Error handling: Fails entire operation if video upload fails (by design)
     - Transcript upload failures logged but don't stop process (optional field)

3. **Database Column Name Fixes** (`server/src/routes/upload.ts`)
   - ✅ **GET /upload/files**: Fixed all old column names to new schema
     - `UserId` → `UploadedBy`
     - `CourseId/LessonId` → `RelatedEntityType/RelatedEntityId`
     - `OriginalName` → `FileName`
     - `Url` → `FilePath`
     - `Size` → `FileSize`
     - `CreatedAt` → `UploadedAt`
   - ✅ **DELETE /upload/:fileId**: Updated column references and file path extraction
   - ✅ POST endpoint was already correct (fixed in previous session)

4. **Accessibility Fixes** - Resolved aria-hidden warnings
   - ✅ Added `disableEnforceFocus` prop to all Dialog components:
     - `CourseCreationForm.tsx`
     - `LessonEditor.tsx` (pages/Instructor)
     - `FileUpload.tsx`
     - `StudentManagement.tsx`
     - `Tutoring.tsx`
     - `Chat.tsx`
     - `AIEnhancedAssessmentResults.tsx`
   - ✅ Prevents MUI accessibility warning: "Blocked aria-hidden on element with descendant focus"

#### Architecture Benefits
- ✅ **No Orphaned Files**: Files only saved if course/lesson actually created
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users can preview files before upload
- ✅ **Cleaner Database**: No orphaned FileUploads records
- ✅ **Storage Efficiency**: No wasted disk space on unused videos
- ✅ **Clear User Intent**: Upload happens on explicit publish action

#### LessonEditor Components - No Changes Needed
- ℹ️ `pages/Instructor/LessonEditor.tsx` and `components/Lessons/LessonEditor.tsx` already have `courseId` available
- ℹ️ Immediate upload is acceptable for editing existing lessons (course already exists)
- ℹ️ Only CourseCreationForm needed deferred upload (files uploaded before course exists)

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Backend rebuilt with updated upload.ts (port 3001)
- ✅ Frontend running with deferred upload (port 5173)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Database schema aligned
- ✅ CORS configured correctly
- ✅ All accessibility warnings resolved

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE

### Port Configuration (NEVER CHANGE)
- **Backend Server**: ALWAYS port 3001
- **Frontend Client**: ALWAYS port 5173
- **CORS Configuration**: Backend configured for http://localhost:5173
- **NEVER** move or suggest moving to different ports (5174, 5175, etc.)
- **If port in use**: Kill the conflicting process, DO NOT change port numbers
- **Reason**: Port changes cause CORS mismatches and API connection failures

### Starting Servers
```bash
# ALWAYS kill all node processes first if ports are in use
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Start backend on 3001
cd D:\exampleProjects\startupexample1\server
npm run dev

# Start frontend on 5173
cd D:\exampleProjects\startupexample1\client
npm run dev
```

## 💡 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Field Naming**: Backend uses camelCase in API responses (not PascalCase from database)
2. **Assessment Preview**: Uses `IsPreview` database field to separate analytics
3. **Course Integration**: Hybrid approach - real API data with fallback UI structure
4. **License Choice**: Proprietary license for IP protection
5. **Property Name Handling**: Systematic approach to handle database capitalized fields vs frontend lowercase expectations
