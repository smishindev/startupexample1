### Implementation Details - Phase 2

#### **1. Database Table**

Created `EmailDigests` table to store notifications for digest delivery:
- Tracks userId, notificationId, frequency (daily/weekly)
- ScheduledFor datetime for delivery timing
- Sent flag and SentAt timestamp
- Foreign keys to Users and Notifications tables
- 3 performance indexes for efficient queries

#### **2. EmailDigestService**

Complete service with all digest management functionality:

**Core Methods**:
- `addToDigest()` - Queue notification for digest delivery
- `calculateScheduledTime()` - Smart scheduling (next 8 AM or Monday)
- `getDigestsToSend()` - Fetch ready digests grouped by user
- `sendDailyDigests()` - Process and send all daily digests
- `sendWeeklyDigests()` - Process and send all weekly digests
- `markDigestAsSent()` - Update sent status after delivery
- `cleanupOldDigests()` - Remove digests older than 30 days
- `getDigestStats()` - Get digest statistics for monitoring

**Features**:
- Groups notifications by user for efficient processing
- Handles errors gracefully (one failure doesn't block others)
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- Transaction-safe operations

#### **3. Digest Email Templates**

Professional HTML email templates with:
- Summary section showing notification count by type
- Type-specific icons and colors (📈 📝 🏆 ⚠️ 💬 📚)
- Notification list (max 20, with "view more" link)
- Priority badges for urgent/high priority items
- Action links for notifications with URLs
- Preference management links
- Mobile-responsive design

#### **4. NotificationService Integration**

Enhanced notification creation to support digest queueing:
```typescript
if (preferences.EmailDigestFrequency === 'daily' || preferences.EmailDigestFrequency === 'weekly') {
  // Add to digest queue for later delivery
  EmailDigestService.addToDigest(userId, notificationId, frequency);
}
```

#### **5. Cron Job Scheduling**

Automated digest sending with node-cron:

**Daily Digest** - `0 8 * * *` (Every day at 8 AM):
- Fetches all pending daily digests
- Sends email to each user with their notifications
- Marks digest entries as sent
- Cleans up old sent digests

**Weekly Digest** - `0 8 * * 1` (Every Monday at 8 AM):
- Fetches all pending weekly digests
- Sends email to each user with their week's notifications
- Marks digest entries as sent

**Server Startup Output**:
```
✅ Notification queue processor scheduled (every 5 minutes)
✅ Daily digest scheduler active (8 AM daily)
✅ Weekly digest scheduler active (Monday 8 AM)
```

#### **6. User Experience Flow**

**User Sets Preference to "Daily"**:
1. Notifications are created normally (in-app bell updates)
2. Each notification is queued to EmailDigests table
3. ScheduledFor is calculated as next 8 AM
4. At 8 AM next day, cron job runs
5. User receives ONE email with all notifications since last digest
6. Digest entries marked as sent

**User Sets Preference to "Weekly"**:
1. Same as daily, but scheduled for next Monday 8 AM
2. ONE email per week with all week's notifications

**User Sets Preference to "Realtime"** (Phase 1):
1. Each notification sends immediate email
2. No digest queueing

**User Sets Preference to "None"**:
1. No emails sent at all
2. Only in-app notifications

---

###Phase 1 Implementation Summary (from earlier)

**Problem**: 
1. No email delivery for notifications - only in-app bell notifications
2. Users with email preferences enabled received no emails
3. EmailDigestFrequency setting (realtime/daily/weekly) was ignored
4. No email templates for different notification types

**Solution**: 

1. **Enhanced EmailService** (`server/src/services/EmailService.ts`)
   - New method: `sendNotificationEmail()` with full notification data
   - 6 type-specific email templates with unique styling
   - Priority badges for urgent/high priority notifications
   - Action buttons when actionUrl is provided
   - Professional HTML with inline styles
   - Plain text fallback for all emails

2. **Enhanced NotificationService** (`server/src/services/NotificationService.ts`)
   - Added EmailService import
   - New private method: `sendEmailNotification(userId, notification)`
   - Fetches user email and firstName from database
   - Converts relative URLs to absolute URLs for email links
   - Integrated into `createNotification()` and `processQueuedNotifications()`

3. **Test Endpoint** (`server/src/routes/notifications.ts`)
   - `POST /api/notifications/test-all-types`
   - Sends 6 realistic test notifications
   - Perfect for testing email delivery

### Implementation Details - Phase 3

#### **1. Email Tracking System**

**EmailTrackingEvents Table**:
- Tracks 5 event types: sent, opened, clicked, bounced, failed
- Unique tracking tokens for each email sent
- Captures user agent, IP address, clicked URLs
- Links to NotificationId or DigestId for traceability
- 4 performance indexes for analytics queries

**Tracking Flow**:
1. Email sent → Generate tracking token → Record "sent" event
2. User opens email → Tracking pixel loads → Record "opened" event (first open only)
3. User clicks link → Redirect through tracking URL → Record "clicked" event → Redirect to target
4. Email bounces → Webhook/SMTP callback → Record "bounced" event

**Tracking Pixel**:
- 1x1 transparent GIF embedded in email footer
- Non-blocking request (doesn't affect email delivery)
- First open only (duplicate opens ignored)
- Endpoint: `/api/email/track/:token/pixel.gif`

**Click Tracking**:
- All action URLs wrapped with tracking redirect
- Format: `/api/email/track/:token/click?url=<target>`
- Records click event then redirects to target URL
- Allows multiple clicks per email

#### **2. EmailAnalyticsService**

**Core Methods** (10 methods):
- `recordEmailSent()` - Generate tracking token and record sent event
- `recordEmailOpen()` - Track email open (pixel load)
- `recordEmailClick()` - Track link clicks
- `recordEmailBounce()` - Handle bounce notifications
- `recordEmailFailure()` - Log email sending failures
- `generateUnsubscribeToken()` - Create secure unsubscribe tokens
- `processUnsubscribe()` - Handle unsubscribe requests
- `getUserEmailStats()` - Get analytics for specific user
- `getSystemEmailStats()` - Get system-wide analytics (admin)
- `cleanupOldEvents()` - Remove tracking data older than 90 days

**Analytics Metrics**:
- Sent count, opened count, clicked count, bounced count, failed count
- Open rate (opened / sent * 100)
- Click rate (clicked / sent * 100)
- Breakdown by email type (notification, digest, verification, etc.)
- Time-based queries (last 7/30/90 days)

#### **3. Unsubscribe System**

**EmailUnsubscribeTokens Table**:
- Secure tokens (64 hex characters, cryptographically random)
- Per-user tokens (one token per unsubscribe link)
- Optional email type (unsubscribe from specific type or ALL emails)
- Expiration support (NULL = permanent)
- UsedAt tracking (prevents reuse)

**Unsubscribe Flow**:
1. User clicks unsubscribe link in email footer
2. Token validated (exists, not used, not expired)
3. NotificationPreferences updated:
   - `EnableEmailNotifications = 0` (for all emails)
   - OR `EmailDigestFrequency = 'none'` (for digest only)
   - `UnsubscribedAt = GETUTCDATE()`
   - `UnsubscribeReason` stored
4. Beautiful confirmation page displayed
5. Token marked as used (`UsedAt = GETUTCDATE()`)

**Unsubscribe Page**:
- Professional HTML design with gradient background
- Success confirmation with user's email address
- Option to return to platform
- Mentions preference re-subscription option
- Mobile-responsive

#### **4. Email Template Enhancements**

**All Emails Now Include**:
- **Tracking Pixel**: `<img src="/api/email/track/{token}/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" />`
- **Tracked Action URLs**: Wrapped with `/api/email/track/{token}/click?url={target}`
- **Unsubscribe Link**: "Manage Preferences | View Notifications | Unsubscribe"
- **Server URL**: Configurable via `SERVER_URL` environment variable

**Notification Emails**:
- userId and notificationId passed to tracking
- Action buttons tracked
- Preference management links updated

**Digest Emails**:
- userId and digestId passed to tracking
- Each notification's action link tracked
- Digest-specific unsubscribe option

#### **5. API Endpoints**

**Tracking Endpoints** (no auth required):
- `GET /api/email/track/:token/pixel.gif` - Tracking pixel (returns 1x1 GIF)
- `GET /api/email/track/:token/click?url=<target>` - Click tracking + redirect
- `GET /api/email/unsubscribe/:token` - One-click unsubscribe page

**Analytics Endpoints** (auth required):
- `GET /api/email/analytics/me` - User's email statistics (authenticated users)
- `GET /api/email/analytics/system?days=30` - System-wide stats (admin only)

**Response Format** (analytics):
```json
{
  "sent": 150,
  "opened": 120,
  "clicked": 45,
  "bounced": 2,
  "failed": 3,
  "openRate": 80.0,
  "clickRate": 30.0,
  "byType": [

## 📜 PREVIOUS UPDATES

### 🔔 Notifications Center - December 22, 2025

**Full-featured notifications management system with real-time synchronization**

#### Implementation Summary
✅ **NotificationsPage**: Full-page list with filters, pagination, and actions  
✅ **Enhanced NotificationBell**: Unread + queued count badges, "View All" link  
✅ **Server-side Filtering**: Type, priority, limit, offset query params  
✅ **Client Pagination**: 20 items per page with MUI Pagination component  
✅ **Real-time Sync**: Socket.IO cross-tab synchronization for all actions  
✅ **Click Navigation**: ActionUrl support for navigating to related content  
✅ **Settings Integration**: "Preferences" button links to notification settings  
✅ **Date Handling**: Proper UTC storage and local timezone display  
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: SUCCESS (no errors)  
✅ **Files Created**: 1 new page (NotificationsPage.tsx)  
✅ **Files Modified**: 5 files (NotificationBell, notificationApi, socketService, NotificationService, routes)  
✅ **Duration**: ~90 minutes full implementation  

#### What Was Implemented

**Problem**: 
1. No dedicated notifications management page - "View All" redirected to dashboard
2. Bell lacked queued count badge for quiet hours notifications
3. No cross-tab synchronization for read/delete actions
4. No server-side pagination or filtering
5. Missing navigation support for actionable notifications

**Solution**: 

1. **Created NotificationsPage** (`client/src/pages/Notifications/NotificationsPage.tsx`)
   - Full notifications list with real-time updates
   - All/Unread toggle filter
   - Type filter (progress, risk, intervention, achievement, assignment, course)
   - Priority filter (urgent, high, normal, low)
   - Pagination (20 items per page)
   - Individual mark read and delete actions
   - Mark all read button
   - Settings/Preferences shortcut button
   - Click-to-navigate for notifications with ActionUrl
   - Socket.IO listeners for cross-tab sync

2. **Enhanced NotificationBell** (`client/src/components/Notifications/NotificationBell.tsx`)
   - Added queued count badge (blue, secondary position)
   - Updated tooltip to show queued status
   - Fixed text wrapping for long notification titles/messages
   - Added socket listener for notification-deleted events
   - Always refresh on dropdown open

3. **Server-side Enhancements** (`server/src/services/NotificationService.ts`, `server/src/routes/notifications.ts`)
   - Added pagination parameters (limit, offset) to getUserNotifications
   - Added server-side filtering (type, priority)
   - Emit socket events: notification-read, notifications-read-all, notification-deleted
   - Return pagination metadata (hasMore flag)

4. **Client API Updates** (`client/src/services/notificationApi.ts`, `client/src/services/socketService.ts`)
   - Updated getNotifications to return { notifications, hasMore }
   - Added getQueuedCount() method
   - Added socket listeners: onNotificationsReadAll, onNotificationDeleted

5. **Routing** (`client/src/App.tsx`)
   - Added /notifications route with ProtectedRoute wrapper

#### Real-time Socket Events

**Server Emits**:
- `notification-created`: When new notification is sent to user
- `notification-read`: When single notification marked as read
- `notifications-read-all`: When all notifications marked as read
- `notification-deleted`: When notification is deleted

**Client Listeners**:
- NotificationBell: All 4 events for dropdown sync
- NotificationsPage: All 4 events for page sync
- Cross-tab synchronization: Changes in one tab update all other tabs

#### Date Handling ✅ VERIFIED CORRECT

**Database**: Uses `GETUTCDATE()` for CreatedAt, ReadAt, ExpiresAt  
**Backend**: Returns ISO 8601 UTC strings with 'Z' suffix  
**Frontend**: Uses `date-fns` formatDistanceToNow (auto-converts to local timezone)  
**Display**: "5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago" relative times  

#### Testing Completed

✅ Bell badge shows unread count  
✅ Queued badge appears during quiet hours  
✅ "View All" navigates to /notifications  
✅ Filters work (type, priority, all/unread)  
✅ Pagination with 20+ notifications  
✅ Mark read updates count in real-time  
✅ Delete removes from list and updates count  
✅ Cross-tab sync: delete in one tab updates other tabs  
✅ Click notification with ActionUrl navigates correctly  
✅ Settings button links to preferences  
✅ Text wrapping for long notification messages

## 📊 Previous Update - December 18, 2025

### 📚 Bookmark System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Fixed broken bookmark functionality in CourseDetail page**

#### Implementation Summary
✅ **Issue Fixed**: TODO comment removed from CourseDetailPage.tsx (not CourseDetail.tsx - wrong file initially)  
✅ **API Integration**: BookmarkApi service connected to CourseDetailPage and CoursesPage  
✅ **User Feedback**: Snackbar notifications for success/error states  
✅ **Authentication**: Login requirement enforced  
✅ **Persistence**: Initial bookmark status loaded on page mount  
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: SUCCESS (no errors)  
✅ **Files Modified**: 2 files (CourseDetailPage.tsx, CoursesPage.tsx)  
✅ **Duration**: ~15 minutes implementation  

#### What Was Implemented

**Problem**: Two issues discovered:
1. CourseDetailPage.tsx (actual file in use) had basic bookmark toggle without API persistence
2. User feedback was missing - no visual confirmation of bookmark actions

**Solution**: 
1. **Added BookmarkApi integration to CourseDetailPage.tsx**
   - Connected to existing bookmark API service
   - All 6 API endpoints already implemented (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, batch operations)
   - Fixed missing persistence to database

2. **Replaced handleBookmark function in both files**
   - Authentication check: Shows warning toast if not logged in
   - API calls: `BookmarkApi.addBookmark()` or `removeBookmark()`
   - Success feedback: "Course bookmarked successfully" / "Bookmark removed successfully" toasts
   - Error handling: "Failed to update bookmark" toast
   - State update: `setIsBookmarked()` after successful API call

3. **Added initial bookmark status fetch (CourseDetailPage)**
   - New function: `loadBookmarkStatus()`
   - Called in useEffect when page loads
   - Fetches current bookmark state from backend
   - Ensures UI matches database state

4. **Added Snackbar components to both pages**
   - Material-UI Snackbar component
   - 4-second auto-hide duration
   - Success/warning/error severities
   - Bottom-center positioning with z-index 9999
   - Filled variant for better visibility

#### System-Wide Context (Already Working)

**Database** ✅ COMPLETE (No changes needed)
- Table: `dbo.Bookmarks` with 3 indexes
- Structure: Id, UserId, CourseId, BookmarkedAt, Notes
- Constraints: UNIQUE(UserId, CourseId) prevents duplicates
- Foreign keys: Cascading deletes for Users and Courses

**Backend API** ✅ COMPLETE (No changes needed)
- File: `server/src/routes/bookmarks.ts` (277 lines)
- 6 endpoints: GET /, POST /:courseId, DELETE /:courseId, GET /check/:courseId, PATCH /:courseId/notes, POST /batch-check
- Features: Duplicate prevention, course validation, authentication

**Frontend API Service** ✅ COMPLETE (No changes needed)
- File: `client/src/services/bookmarkApi.ts`
- 6 methods: getBookmarks(), addBookmark(), removeBookmark(), checkBookmarkStatus(), updateBookmarkNotes(), batchCheckBookmarks()

**Other Pages Already Working** ✅
- CoursesPage: Full bookmark CRUD via CourseCard component + Snackbar feedback (Updated Dec 18)
- MyLearningPage: Bookmark toggle via CourseCard
- Bookmarked Tab: Dedicated tab in CoursesPage with pagination

#### Code Changes

**File 1**: `client/src/pages/Course/CourseDetailPage.tsx` (Correct file - the one actually used)

1. **Imports Added** (lines ~55-56):
```typescript
import { BookmarkApi } from '../../services/bookmarkApi';
// Added Snackbar to Material-UI imports
```

2. **State Added** (lines ~70-74):
```typescript
const [snackbar, setSnackbar] = useState<{
  open: boolean;
  message: string;
  severity: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
}>({ open: false, message: '', severity: 'info' });
```

3. **New Function** (lines ~87-100):
```typescript
const loadBookmarkStatus = async () => {
  try {
    if (id && user) {
      const status = await BookmarkApi.checkBookmarkStatus(id);
      setIsBookmarked(status.isBookmarked);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error loading bookmark status:', err);
    // Don't show error to user, just default to not bookmarked
  }
};
```

4. **Updated useEffect** (line ~82):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (id) {
    loadCourseDetails();
    if (user) {
      loadEnrollmentStatus();
      loadBookmarkStatus(); // NEW: Load bookmark status
    }
  }
}, [id, user]);
```

5. **Replaced handleBookmark** (lines ~163-201):
```typescript
const handleBookmark = async () => {
  if (!user) {
    setSnackbar({
      open: true,
      message: 'Please log in to bookmark courses',
      severity: 'warning'
    });
    return;
  }

  try {
    const newBookmarkState = !isBookmarked;
    
    if (newBookmarkState) {
      await BookmarkApi.addBookmark(id!);
      setSnackbar({
        open: true,
        message: 'Course bookmarked successfully',
        severity: 'success'
      });
    } else {
      await BookmarkApi.removeBookmark(id!);
      setSnackbar({
        open: true,
        message: 'Bookmark removed successfully',
        severity: 'success'
      });
    }
    
    setIsBookmarked(newBookmarkState);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update bookmark:', error);
    setSnackbar({
      open: true,
      message: 'Failed to update bookmark. Please try again.',
      severity: 'error'
    });
  }
};
```

6. **Snackbar Component** (lines ~610-625):
```tsx
<Snackbar
  open={snackbar.open}
  autoHideDuration={4000}
  onClose={() => setSnackbar({ ...snackbar, open: false })}
  anchorOrigin={{ vertical: 'bottom', horizontal: 'center' }}
>
  <Alert 
    onClose={() => setSnackbar({ ...snackbar, open: false })} 
    severity={snackbar.severity}
    sx={{ width: '100%' }}
  >
    {snackbar.message}
  </Alert>
</Snackbar>
```

#### Testing Checklist

**Manual Testing Required** (User should test):
- [ ] Not logged in: Click bookmark → Shows warning toast
- [ ] Logged in: Click bookmark → Icon fills, success toast
- [ ] Refresh page: Bookmark state persists (icon still filled)
- [ ] Click again: Bookmark removed, success toast
- [ ] Navigate to CoursesPage → Bookmarked tab: Course appears in list
- [ ] Unbookmark from CoursesPage: Course disappears from detail page

## 🔥 PREVIOUS UPDATE - December 18, 2025

### 🎉 Notification Preferences Enforcement - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

**All notification preference features fully implemented and tested**

#### Implementation Summary
✅ **Database Complete**: NotificationQueue table with 3 indexes  
✅ **Backend Complete**: 6 queue management methods + cron job  
✅ **Frontend Complete**: Quiet hours clear buttons added  
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: SUCCESS (no errors)  
✅ **Manual Testing**: Verified working (queuing during quiet hours)  
✅ **Files Modified**: 7 files (5 backend, 1 frontend, 1 database)  
✅ **Dependencies**: node-cron v3.0.3 installed  
✅ **Duration**: ~4 hours implementation + testing  

#### What Was Implemented

**Phase 1: Database Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETE
- File: `database/add_notification_queue.sql`
- Created NotificationQueue table (17 columns)
  - Id, UserId, Type, Priority, Title, Message, Data
  - ActionUrl, ActionText, RelatedEntityId, RelatedEntityType
  - ExpiresAt, QueuedAt, DeliveredAt, Status, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt
- 3 Indexes:
  - IX_NotificationQueue_UserId (performance)
  - IX_NotificationQueue_Status (filtered: WHERE Status='queued')
  - IX_NotificationQueue_QueuedAt (ordering)
- Updated: `database/schema.sql` with full documentation

**Phase 2: Backend Queue System** ✅ COMPLETE
- File: `server/src/services/NotificationService.ts` (458 → 740 lines)
- Added 6 queue management methods:
  1. `queueNotification(params)` - Store notification during quiet hours
  2. `processQueuedNotifications()` - Deliver queued items after quiet hours
  3. `createNotificationDirect(params)` - Bypass preferences for queued delivery
  4. `markQueuedAsDelivered(queueId)` - Update Status='delivered'
  5. `cleanupExpiredQueue()` - Mark expired items Status='expired'
  6. `getQueuedCount(userId)` - Return count of queued notifications
- Modified: `createNotification()` line 83 to call `queueNotification()` during quiet hours

**Phase 3: Cron Job Scheduler** ✅ COMPLETE
- File: `server/src/index.ts`
- Installed: node-cron v3.0.3 + @types/node-cron
- Schedule: Every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- Actions:
  - Calls `processQueuedNotifications()` - Delivers queued items
  - Calls `cleanupExpiredQueue()` - Marks expired items
- Logging: "⏰ [CRON] Running scheduled...", "✅ [CRON] Queue processing complete: X delivered, Y expired"

**Phase 4: API Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETE
- File: `server/src/routes/notifications.ts`
- New endpoints:
  1. `GET /api/notifications/queue/count` - Returns queued notification count for user
  2. `POST /api/notifications/test` - Development testing endpoint
- Both use authenticateToken middleware

**Phase 5: Frontend Enhancements** ✅ COMPLETE
- File: `client/src/pages/Profile/ProfilePage.tsx`
- Added clear (X) buttons to quiet hours time inputs
- Click X to remove start/end times and disable quiet hours
- Improves UX - previously no way to clear quiet hours once set

**Phase 6: Testing & Verification** ✅ COMPLETE
- Created: `test-notification-preferences.js` (350+ lines)
- 3 test suites, 10 test scenarios
- Manual testing performed:
  - Set quiet hours (13:00-23:59)
  - Joined office hours queue → notification queued (not delivered)
  - Cleared quiet hours
  - Waited 5 minutes → cron job delivered 3 notifications
  - Verified notifications appeared in bell after page refresh

#### Features Enforced

**1. Quiet Hours** (`QuietHoursStart`, `QuietHoursEnd` settings)
- **During Quiet Hours**: Notifications queued in NotificationQueue table ✅ Tested
- **After Quiet Hours**: Cron job delivers queued notifications ✅ Tested
- **Clear Buttons**: X buttons to remove quiet hours settings ✅ Added
- Enforced at: NotificationService.createNotification() line 81-85

**2. Notification Type Filtering** (5 preference toggles)
- **Progress Updates**: EnableProgressNotifications ✅ Enforced
- **Achievement Unlocked**: EnableAchievementNotifications ✅ Enforced
- **Risk Alerts**: EnableRiskAlertNotifications ✅ Enforced
- **Course Updates**: EnableCourseNotifications ✅ Enforced
- **Assignments**: EnableAssignmentNotifications ✅ Enforced
- Enforced at: NotificationService.shouldSendNotification() line 431-451

**3. Cron Job Processing**
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
- **Actions**:
  - Query all Status='queued' notifications
  - Check if quiet hours ended for each user
  - Deliver via createNotificationDirect() (bypasses preferences)
  - Mark Status='delivered', set DeliveredAt timestamp
  - Emit real-time Socket.IO event
- **Cleanup**: Mark expired items (past ExpiresAt) as Status='expired'
- Verified: 3 notifications delivered successfully in production test

#### Technical Details

**Database Changes:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE NotificationQueue (
  Id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT NEWID(),
  UserId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
  Status NVARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'queued', -- 'queued', 'delivered', 'expired'
  QueuedAt DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
  DeliveredAt DATETIME2 NULL,
  -- ... 12 more columns
)
```

**Cron Job Setup:**
```typescript
cron.schedule('*/5 * * * *', async () => {
  const notificationService = new NotificationService(io);
  await notificationService.processQueuedNotifications();
  await notificationService.cleanupExpiredQueue();
});
```

**Quiet Hours Logic:**
```typescript
if (this.isInQuietHours(preferences)) {
  return await this.queueNotification(params);
}
```

#### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/notifications/queue/count` - Returns `{ success: true, count: N }`
- `POST /api/notifications/test` - Testing endpoint `{ type, title, message }`

#### Files Modified
**Backend (5 files):**

5. `database/schema.sql` - NotificationQueue documentation

**Frontend (1 file):**
6. `client/src/pages/Profile/ProfilePage.tsx` - Clear buttons for quiet hours

**Database (1 file):**
7. `database/add_notification_queue.sql` - Migration script

**Test (1 file):**
8. `test-notification-preferences.js` - Automated test suite

#### Known Limitations
- Email/SMS notifications not yet implemented (future enhancement)
- Cron job runs every 5 minutes (not immediate after quiet hours end)
- Real-time Socket.IO delivery may require page refresh if reconnections occur

#### Next Steps
- ✅ Feature complete and production ready
- 📝 Documentation updated
- 🔄 Consider adding frontend badge for queued notification count (optional)
- 📧 Future: Email/SMS notification delivery system

#### Bug Fixes Applied

**Bug #1: Instructor Override Not Working in Student Management**
- File: `server/src/routes/students.ts` (lines 81-107)
- Issue: Privacy filtering was blocking instructors from seeing their students' emails
- Fix: Removed privacy filtering from /api/students endpoint
- Reasoning: Endpoint already filtered by InstructorId, only returns instructor's own students
- Result: Instructors now always see emails in Student Management page ✅
- **Verified Working**: Jan 10, 2026 - Instructor override correctly shows all student emails regardless of ShowEmail setting

**Bug #2: Course Price Showing for Enrolled Students**
- Files: `client/src/pages/Courses/CourseDetail.tsx`, `client/src/pages/Course/CourseDetailPage.tsx`
- Issue: Students who paid for course still saw "23% OFF" and price
- Fix: Added conditional rendering based on `enrollmentStatus?.isEnrolled`
- Result: Price hidden for enrolled students ✅

**Bug #3: TypeScript Compilation Errors**
- Files: 7 frontend files with 24 total errors
- Errors: Unused imports, type mismatches, function signatures

- ✅ **21 files** identified for modification (16 backend, 5 frontend)
- ✅ **4 privacy settings** enforcement: ProfileVisibility, ShowEmail, ShowProgress, AllowMessages
- ✅ **7 phases** with detailed implementation steps
- ✅ **15 backend endpoints** requiring privacy checks
- ✅ **All affected areas** mapped: profile viewing, user lists, progress data, messaging

#### Research Completed
- ✅ Analyzed all profile/user data API endpoints
- ✅ Mapped progress-related endpoints (dashboard, analytics, instructor views)
- ✅ Reviewed chat/messaging system (currently disabled - 501 status)
- ✅ Identified frontend components needing updates
- ✅ Documented instructor overrides for course management

#### Key Findings

**Profile Visibility**:
- Affects: User lists, online presence, study groups, office hours queue
- Requires: New profile viewing endpoint with visibility checks
- Logic: public (anyone) → students (enrolled together) → private (none)

**Show Email**:
- Affects: 8 backend routes returning user data
- Implementation: Conditional email exclusion in all responses
- Exception: Own profile always shows email

**Show Progress**:
- Affects: Dashboard, analytics, progress tracking, instructor views
- Requires: Instructor override for course management
- Logic: Hide from public, allow for course instructors

**Allow Messages**:
- Affects: Chat system (currently disabled)
- Implementation: Permission check before message creation
- Status: Ready for implementation when chat is re-enabled

#### Email Verification Priority Update

**Status**: ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Nov 20, 2025)
- Backend: VerificationService with 6-digit codes
- Database: EmailVerified field tracking
- SendGrid integration working
- Frontend: Verification UI complete

**Priority**: **MEDIUM** (implement after Privacy Settings)

**When to Enforce**:
1. Before course purchases (payment security)
2. Before becoming instructor (identity verification)
3. Before publishing courses (content creator verification)
4. Before instructor payouts (financial security)

**Rationale**:
- Currently not blocking any functionality
- Users can browse and learn without verification
- Should be enforced alongside payment/instructor features
- Low risk to implement after privacy settings

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
- Add `requireEmailVerification` middleware
- Apply to payment and instructor endpoints
- Add frontend verification prompts
- Show verification status banner

#### Implementation Time Estimates
- **Total**: 3-4 hours for complete privacy enforcement
- Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure (1 hour)
- Phase 2: Profile Visibility (1 hour)
- Phase 3: Show Email (30 min)
- Phase 4: Show Progress (1 hour)
- Phase 5: Allow Messages (30 min)
- Phase 6: Frontend Updates (30 min)
- Phase 7: Testing (30 min)

#### Next Steps
**READY TO IMPLEMENT**: Start with Phase 1 (Backend Infrastructure)
- Create privacy helper methods in SettingsService
- Build foundation for all privacy checks
- Ensure system-wide consistency

**Documentation**: `PRIVACY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- 600+ lines of complete implementation documentation
- Complete file-by-file modification list
- Code examples for each enforcement pattern
- Testing checklist and validation criteria

### 🔧 Date Handling Audit & Fixes

**All payment system date operations verified and fixed for UTC/timezone safety**

#### Issues Found & Fixed
1. **Date Calculation Inconsistency**
   - ❌ Old: Mixed `Date.now()` and `new Date().getTime()`
   - ✅ Fixed: Consistent `new Date()` object creation

2. **Refund Eligibility (30-Day Window)**
   - Frontend: `TransactionsPage.tsx` - `isRefundEligible()`, `getDaysRemaining()`
   - Backend: `payments.ts` - Refund request validation
   - ✅ Both now use identical UTC timestamp calculations

3. **Database Queries**
   - ✅ All payment queries use `GETUTCDATE()` (correct)
   - ⚠️ Some non-payment queries use `GETDATE()` (low priority, documented)

#### Key Fixes Applied
```typescript
// BEFORE (inconsistent)
const days = Math.floor((Date.now() - new Date(date).getTime()) / (1000*60*60*24));

// AFTER (timezone-safe)
const purchaseDate = new Date(transaction.CreatedAt);
const now = new Date();
const days = Math.floor((now.getTime() - purchaseDate.getTime()) / (1000*60*60*24));
```

#### Verification
- ✅ Payment timestamps: All UTC via `GETUTCDATE()`
- ✅ Date calculations: Timezone-independent (using `.getTime()`)
- ✅ Date displays: Automatic local timezone conversion (date-fns)
- ✅ 30-day refund window: Consistent frontend + backend
- ✅ Idempotency check: UTC-based (30-minute window)
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors

#### Documentation
- Created [DATE_HANDLING_GUIDE.md](DATE_HANDLING_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive date handling reference
- Covers: UTC storage, timezone-safe calculations, display formatting, testing scenarios

#### Files Updated
- `client/src/pages/Profile/TransactionsPage.tsx` - Fixed date calculations
- `server/src/routes/payments.ts` - Fixed refund eligibility check
- `DATE_HANDLING_GUIDE.md` - NEW comprehensive guide

**Status**: ✅ All payment date operations production-ready and timezone-safe

## 📋 PREVIOUS UPDATE - November 27, 2025

### Real-time Notifications Frontend Integration - PHASE 1 COMPLETE

**Socket.io real-time notifications implemented** - Replaced 30-second polling with instant real-time updates

#### Problem Solved
- ❌ **Old Behavior**: NotificationBell used 30-second polling (setInterval) → delayed notifications → poor UX
- ✅ **New Behavior**: Socket.io connection → instant notification delivery → toast alerts for urgent items → <1 second latency

#### Implementation Details

**1. Socket Connection Lifecycle**
- ✅ Socket connects on NotificationBell mount
- ✅ JWT authentication via socket.handshake.auth.token
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on unmount (disconnect)
- ✅ Graceful fallback if socket fails (initial REST fetch still works)

**2. Real-time Notification Listener**
- ✅ `socketService.onNotification()` registered
- ✅ New notifications prepended to state instantly

## 🎭 USER SCENARIOS & ACCESS CONTROL - November 22, 2025

### Complete User Role & Access Matrix

The platform supports multiple user roles and scenarios, each with specific permissions and behaviors:

#### **1. Student Scenarios**

**1.1 Student - Course Not Purchased**
- ✅ Can browse course catalog and view course details
- ✅ Can see course preview content (description, instructor, curriculum)
- ❌ Cannot access lesson content (videos, materials, assessments)
- ✅ Sees "Purchase Course" button with pricing
- ✅ Can proceed to checkout flow
- **Progress Tracking**: None (no enrollment)

**1.2 Student - Course Purchased/Enrolled**
- ✅ Full access to all course content (lessons, videos, assessments)
- ✅ Progress tracking active (lesson completion, video position, quiz scores)
- ✅ Video progress auto-saved every 5 seconds
- ✅ Lesson completion tracking with CompletedAt timestamps
- ✅ Can mark lessons as complete
- ✅ Sees progress indicators and completion badges
- ✅ Course progress contributes to analytics and certificates
- **Progress Tracking**: Full tracking enabled
- **UI Elements**: Progress bars, completion chips, "Mark Complete" button

#### **2. Instructor Scenarios**

**2.1 Instructor - Viewing Own Course/Lessons (Preview Mode)**
- ✅ Full access to all course content (no purchase required)
- ✅ Sees "Preview Mode" badge indicator (warning color)
- ❌ No progress tracking (views don't count in analytics)
- ❌ Video progress not saved (always starts at 0:00)
- ❌ Cannot mark lessons as complete
- ❌ No completion status displayed
- ❌ Lesson progress indicators hidden
- ✅ Can navigate between lessons freely
- ✅ Sees "Manage Course" button instead of "Purchase Course"
- **Purpose**: Quality assurance, content review, updates verification
- **Progress Tracking**: Completely disabled to prevent analytics contamination
- **UI Elements**: "Preview Mode" chip, disabled completion buttons, no progress bars

**2.2 Instructor - Viewing Another Instructor's Course (Not Enrolled)**
- ✅ Same as "Student - Course Not Purchased"
- ✅ Can browse and view course details
- ❌ Cannot access lesson content without purchase
- ✅ Sees "Purchase Course" button
- **Progress Tracking**: None

**2.3 Instructor - Enrolled as Student in Another Instructor's Course**
- ✅ Same as "Student - Course Purchased/Enrolled"
- ✅ Full progress tracking as a student
- ✅ Can mark lessons complete
- ✅ Video progress saved
- ✅ Course completion contributes to their student analytics
- **Progress Tracking**: Full tracking enabled
- **Note**: Instructors can also be students - roles are independent

#### **3. Admin Scenarios**

**3.1 Admin - Full Access**
- ✅ Access to all courses regardless of enrollment
- ✅ Can view all instructor dashboards
- ✅ Can manage users, courses, and content
- ✅ Analytics access across all courses
- **Progress Tracking**: Configurable (typically disabled for admin reviews)

### Access Control Implementation

**Backend Checks**:
- `enrollmentStatus.isInstructor` - Detects if user owns the course
- `enrollmentStatus.isEnrolled` - Detects if user purchased the course
- `req.user.role` - User's role (student/instructor/admin)

**Frontend Behavior**:
- `isInstructorPreview` flag - Disables progress tracking and completion features
- Conditional rendering based on enrollment status
- Role-based UI component visibility

### Key UX Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Instructor preview ≠ Student learning experience
2. **Analytics Integrity**: Instructor views must not contaminate student analytics
3. **Quality Assurance**: Instructors need to verify content without side effects
4. **Dual Roles**: Users can be both instructors and students simultaneously
5. **Clear Indicators**: Visual badges show preview mode vs learning mode

### Technical Implementation Files

- `LessonDetailPage.tsx` - Preview mode detection and UI adjustments
- `CourseDetailPage.tsx` - Button rendering based on enrollment status
- `progressApi.ts` - Progress tracking API (skipped for instructors)
- `videoProgressApi.ts` - Video position saving (disabled for preview)
- `coursesApi.getEnrollmentStatus()` - Returns isInstructor and isEnrolled flags

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - November 15, 2025

### Database Schema Integrity Protocol

**BEFORE removing any database column references from queries:**

1. ✅ **Check column usage across entire codebase** - Use grep_search to find ALL references
2. ✅ **Verify if column is a FEATURE or a BUG** - Check backend routes for intentional usage
3. ✅ **Search frontend for column usage** - Column might be used in UI components
4. ✅ **Review database schema documentation** - Check `database/schema.sql` for column definition
5. ⚠️ **ASSUMPTION**: If column appears in 30+ places = IT'S A FEATURE, not a bug
6. ⚠️ **DEFAULT ACTION**: Add missing column to database, don't break existing functionality

**Recent Example - IsPreview Column Incident (November 15, 2025):**
- ❌ **Wrong Approach**: Attempted to remove `IsPreview` references from queries (would break preview mode feature)
- ✅ **Correct Approach**: Added missing `IsPreview` column to AssessmentSubmissions table
- **Impact**: IsPreview used in 33 backend files + 12 frontend files = core feature for instructor preview mode
- **Lesson**: Always investigate before removing - user's challenge prevented breaking production feature

**Database Column Addition Checklist:**
1. Check if column exists: `sqlcmd -Q "SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TableName'"`
2. Review schema.sql for column definition
3. Create migration script in `database/add_[column_name]_column.sql`
4. Execute migration with proper error handling
5. Verify column added successfully
6. Update schema.sql documentation if needed

## 🔥 LATEST UPDATE - November 22, 2025

### Instructor Preview Mode & User Scenarios Documentation

**Complete role-based access control and UX improvements** - Comprehensive user scenarios documented and instructor preview mode refined

#### User Scenarios Matrix Documented
Added complete user role and access control documentation covering all platform scenarios:
- ✅ Student viewing unpurchased courses
- ✅ Student viewing purchased courses with full progress tracking
- ✅ Instructor viewing own courses (Preview Mode)
- ✅ Instructor viewing other instructors' courses
- ✅ Instructor enrolled as student in other courses
- ✅ Admin full access scenarios

#### Instructor Preview Mode Design Decisions

**Question**: Should instructors see completion status and be able to mark lessons complete when previewing their own courses?

**Answer**: **NO** - Instructor preview mode should be completely isolated from student learning experience.

**Rationale**:
1. **Analytics Integrity**: Instructor actions should not contaminate student analytics
2. **Quality Assurance Purpose**: Preview is for content verification, not learning
3. **Clear Mental Model**: Preview ≠ Learning (different contexts)
4. **No Side Effects**: Instructors reviewing content shouldn't create database records
5. **Professional Tool**: Similar to "preview mode" in CMS systems (WordPress, etc.)

**Instructor Preview Mode Features**:
- ❌ No lesson completion tracking
- ❌ No "Mark Complete" button visible
- ❌ No completion status displayed (no green checkmarks in lesson list)
- ❌ No video progress saved
- ❌ No course progress updates
- ✅ "Preview Mode" warning badge displayed
- ✅ Full content access for review
- ✅ Free navigation between lessons
- ✅ Video starts at 0:00 every time

**Student Learning Mode Features** (when instructor is enrolled as student in another course):
- ✅ Full progress tracking
- ✅ "Mark Complete" button visible
- ✅ Completion status displayed
- ✅ Video progress saved
- ✅ Course completion contributes to analytics

#### UI/UX Improvements Implemented

**1. Course Level Display on Instructor Dashboard**
- ✅ Added Level field to instructor courses backend query
- ✅ Color-coded level chips on course cards:
  - 🟢 Beginner (Green)
  - 🟠 Intermediate (Orange)
  - 🔴 Advanced (Red)

**2. Lesson List Completion Status**
- ✅ CheckCircle (green) - Completed lessons
- ✅ PlayCircleOutline (blue) - Current lesson
- ✅ RadioButtonUnchecked (gray) - Incomplete lessons
- ✅ Secondary text shows "Completed", "Current", or duration
- ✅ Completion status pulled from progress.lessonProgress.CompletedAt

**3. Preview Mode UI Adjustments**
- ✅ "Preview Mode" badge displayed prominently
- ✅ Progress indicators hidden for instructors
- ✅ "Mark Complete" button hidden in preview mode
- ✅ Lesson completion status not shown in preview mode

#### Files Modified (5 files)

**Backend**
1. `server/src/routes/instructor.ts` - Added Level field to courses query and GROUP BY

**Frontend - Services**
2. `client/src/services/instructorApi.ts` - Added level property to InstructorCourse interface

**Frontend - Pages**
3. `client/src/pages/Instructor/InstructorDashboard.tsx` - Added level Chip with color coding to course cards
4. `client/src/pages/Course/LessonDetailPage.tsx` - Updated lesson list to show completion status with proper icons

**Documentation**
5. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Added comprehensive user scenarios and access control matrix

#### Design Principles Established

**Role Separation**:
- Instructors wear two hats: content creator (preview mode) and learner (enrolled as student)
- These roles must remain completely separate in the system
- Preview mode = read-only content verification tool
- Student mode = full interactive learning experience

**Analytics Integrity**:
- Only actual student learning activity should appear in analytics
- Instructor content reviews should leave no trace
- Prevents inflated completion rates and skewed metrics

**Clear Visual Indicators**:
- "Preview Mode" badge clearly distinguishes modes
- Different UI elements shown based on user role
- No confusion between preview and learning contexts

## 📋 PREVIOUS UPDATE - November 21, 2025

### Database Recreation & SQL Login Management

**Critical Issue Resolved** - Database user recreation process documented and automated

#### Problem Identified
When dropping and recreating the database from `schema.sql`, only tables are created - the SQL Server login and database user (`mishin_learn_user`) are lost, causing connection failures on server startup.

#### Solution Implemented
1. ✅ **Updated schema.sql**: Added payment system tables (Transactions, Invoices) to main schema
2. ✅ **Database User Recreation Script**: Created automated user setup process
3. ✅ **Documentation**: Added DATABASE_RECREATION_GUIDE.md with step-by-step instructions

#### Database Recreation Process (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY)
```powershell
# 1. Drop and recreate database
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -Q "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS [startUp1]; CREATE DATABASE [startUp1];"

# 2. Execute schema to create all tables
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -i "database\schema.sql"

# 3. CREATE SQL LOGIN (if not exists)
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -Q "IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.server_principals WHERE name = 'mishin_learn_user') CREATE LOGIN [mishin_learn_user] WITH PASSWORD = 'MishinLearn2024!';"

# 4. CREATE DATABASE USER (if not exists)
sqlcmd -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -E -Q "USE [startUp1]; IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = 'mishin_learn_user') CREATE USER [mishin_learn_user] FOR LOGIN [mishin_learn_user]; ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER [mishin_learn_user];"

# 5. Verify connection
npm run dev  # Should connect successfully
```

#### Files Modified
1. `database/schema.sql` - UPDATED: Added Transactions, Invoices, payment fields to Users table
2. `database/create_db_user.sql` - NEW: Automated user creation script
3. `DATABASE_RECREATION_GUIDE.md` - NEW: Step-by-step recreation guide

#### Why This Happens
- **SQL Server Logins**: Stored at server level (master database)
- **Database Users**: Stored per-database
- **Schema.sql**: Only creates tables, NOT logins/users
- **Result**: Fresh database has no user permissions

#### Prevention
- Always run user creation script after dropping database
- Never rely on schema.sql alone for complete setup
- Use automated script to prevent human error

## 📋 PREVIOUS UPDATE - November 5, 2025

### Upload Progress Enhancement with Beautiful UI & Animations

**Complete UX overhaul of file upload flow** - Professional progress tracking with visual feedback and smooth transitions

#### Problem Solved
- ❌ **Old Behavior**: Parallel uploads (Promise.all) → no progress visibility → instant completion → user confusion
- ✅ **New Behavior**: Sequential uploads → real-time progress tracking → animated status transitions → professional UX

#### Implementation Details

1. **Sequential Upload Processing** (`client/src/pages/Instructor/CourseCreationForm.tsx`)
   - ✅ Changed from `Promise.all()` to `for loop` for sequential file uploads
   - ✅ Uploads one file at a time with live progress updates
   - ✅ Prevents network congestion and provides accurate progress tracking
   - ✅ Total file count calculated upfront: `lessons.reduce()` counting pending video/transcript files

2. **Upload Progress State Management**
   - ✅ Added comprehensive state object with 10 properties:
     - `isOpen: boolean` - Controls dialog visibility
     - `current: number` - Current file number being uploaded
     - `total: number` - Total files to upload
     - `currentFileName: string` - Name of file being uploaded
     - `currentFileProgress: number` - Percentage (0-100) of current file
     - `status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'error'` - Current stage
     - `errorMessage?: string` - Error description if upload fails
     - `failedUploads: Array<...>` - List of failed uploads with details
     - `onComplete?: () => void` - Callback for completion (removed - auto-flow instead)
   - ✅ State updates per-file using `onProgress` callback from `fileUploadApi.uploadFile()`

3. **Upload Progress Dialog with 4 States**

   **State 1: Uploading (📤 Uploading Files)**
   - Shows "Uploading X of Y files"
   - Displays current file name
   - LinearProgress bar with live percentage
   - Warning: "Please don't close this window while files are uploading"
   - Red "Cancel Upload" button

   **State 2: Upload Complete (✓ Upload Complete)** - 1.5 seconds
   - ✅ Large green CheckCircle icon (80px) with Zoom animation
   - Bold text: "All Files Uploaded Successfully!"
   - Shows total file count
   - No buttons - auto-transitions to processing

   **State 3: Processing (⚙️ Creating Course)**
   - 🔄 CircularProgress spinner (60px) with Fade animation
   - Bold text: "Creating Your Course"
   - Subtitle: "Setting up lessons and publishing..."
   - No buttons - auto-completes

   **State 4: Error (⚠ Upload Errors)**
   - Red Alert with error message
   - List of failed uploads with lesson title, file name, error details
   - Gray "Close" button
   - Blue "Retry Failed Uploads" button (restarts publishCourse)

4. **Enhanced Visual Design**
   - ✅ Added MUI imports: `CircularProgress`, `Fade`, `Zoom`, `CheckCircleIcon`
   - ✅ Title icons: 📤 (uploading), ✓ (complete), ⚙️ (processing), ⚠ (error)
   - ✅ Centered layouts with proper spacing (`py: 3`)
   - ✅ Typography hierarchy: h6 for titles, body2 for subtitles
   - ✅ Color coding: success.main (green), error (red), text.secondary (gray)
   - ✅ Smooth transitions between states

5. **Error Handling & Retry**
   - ✅ Distinguishes critical (video) vs optional (transcript) failures
   - ✅ Video upload failure → stops process, shows error dialog
   - ✅ Transcript upload failure → logs error, continues (optional field)
   - ✅ Failed uploads tracked in array with: `{ lessonTitle, fileName, error, lessonIndex }`
   - ✅ Retry button re-invokes `publishCourse()` with fresh state

6. **Cancel Upload Functionality**
   - ✅ Added `cancelUpload: boolean` state flag
   - ✅ Checked between each file upload in the loop
   - ✅ Throws error and exits gracefully if user cancels
   - ✅ Resets `saving` state and closes dialog

7. **Automatic Flow (No Manual Close)**
   - ✅ Upload completes → Shows success for 1.5s → Auto-transitions to processing
   - ✅ Processing shown while `instructorApi.createCourse()` executes
   - ✅ Course created → Dialog closes → Auto-navigates to dashboard
   - ✅ Removed "Close" button from completed state (removed `onComplete` callback)
   - ✅ Seamless user experience with no interruptions

#### Applied to Both Functions
- ✅ `saveDraft()` - Creates unpublished course with uploads
- ✅ `publishCourse()` - Creates and publishes course with uploads
- ✅ Identical upload logic in both functions

#### Architecture Benefits
- ✅ **Professional UX**: Beautiful animations and clear visual feedback
- ✅ **Progress Visibility**: Users see exactly what's happening
- ✅ **Sequential Upload**: One file at a time prevents network overload
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanism for failed uploads
- ✅ **User Control**: Cancel button during uploads
- ✅ **Smooth Flow**: Automatic transitions between states
- ✅ **No Confusion**: Clear status at every stage

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Backend running on port 3001
- ✅ Frontend running on port 5173
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Upload flow tested with multiple videos
- ✅ All transitions working smoothly
- ✅ Auto-navigation to dashboard confirmed

## 🔥 PREVIOUS UPDATE - November 4, 2025

### Deferred File Upload Architecture Implementation

**Complete refactoring to prevent orphaned files** - Files no longer uploaded until course/lesson is published

#### Problem Solved
- ❌ **Old Behavior**: Files uploaded immediately on selection → saved to server/DB even if user cancels → orphaned files accumulate
- ✅ **New Behavior**: Files stored locally in memory → preview shown → uploaded only when user publishes course → no orphans on cancel

#### Implementation Details

1. **FileUpload Component Enhancement** (`client/src/components/Upload/FileUpload.tsx`)
   - ✅ Added `forwardRef` with `useImperativeHandle` to expose upload method
   - ✅ New interface: `FileUploadHandle` with `uploadPendingFile()` and `getPendingFile()` methods
   - ✅ Added props: `deferUpload?: boolean`, `onFileSelected?: (file: File | null) => void`
   - ✅ Added state: `pendingFile: File | null`, `previewUrl: string | null`
   - ✅ Modified `handleFileSelect()`: If `deferUpload={true}`, stores file locally instead of uploading
   - ✅ Preview rendering: Shows video player or image preview with file info and "Will be uploaded when you publish" message
   - ✅ Cleanup: `URL.revokeObjectURL()` in useEffect to prevent memory leaks

2. **CourseCreationForm Updates** (`client/src/pages/Instructor/CourseCreationForm.tsx`)
   - ✅ Imported `FileUploadHandle` and `fileUploadApi`
   - ✅ Added `pendingVideoFile` and `pendingTranscriptFile` to `Lesson` interface
   - ✅ Added refs: `videoFileUploadRef`, `transcriptFileUploadRef` (shared for dialog, works because modal)
   - ✅ Added callbacks: `handleVideoFileSelected`, `handleTranscriptFileSelected`
   - ✅ Updated FileUpload components with `deferUpload={true}`, `ref={videoFileUploadRef}`, `onFileSelected={handleVideoFileSelected}`
   - ✅ Modified `saveDraft()` and `publishCourse()`:
     - Upload all pending files using `fileUploadApi.uploadFile()` with `Promise.all()`
     - Sequential processing per lesson (video first, then transcript)
     - Error handling: Fails entire operation if video upload fails (by design)
     - Transcript upload failures logged but don't stop process (optional field)

3. **Database Column Name Fixes** (`server/src/routes/upload.ts`)
   - ✅ **GET /upload/files**: Fixed all old column names to new schema
     - `UserId` → `UploadedBy`
     - `CourseId/LessonId` → `RelatedEntityType/RelatedEntityId`
     - `OriginalName` → `FileName`
     - `Url` → `FilePath`
     - `Size` → `FileSize`
     - `CreatedAt` → `UploadedAt`
   - ✅ **DELETE /upload/:fileId**: Updated column references and file path extraction
   - ✅ POST endpoint was already correct (fixed in previous session)

4. **Accessibility Fixes** - Resolved aria-hidden warnings
   - ✅ Added `disableEnforceFocus` prop to all Dialog components:
     - `CourseCreationForm.tsx`
     - `LessonEditor.tsx` (pages/Instructor)
     - `FileUpload.tsx`
     - `StudentManagement.tsx`
     - `Tutoring.tsx`
     - `Chat.tsx`
     - `AIEnhancedAssessmentResults.tsx`
   - ✅ Prevents MUI accessibility warning: "Blocked aria-hidden on element with descendant focus"

#### Architecture Benefits
- ✅ **No Orphaned Files**: Files only saved if course/lesson actually created
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users can preview files before upload
- ✅ **Cleaner Database**: No orphaned FileUploads records
- ✅ **Storage Efficiency**: No wasted disk space on unused videos
- ✅ **Clear User Intent**: Upload happens on explicit publish action

#### LessonEditor Components - No Changes Needed
- ℹ️ `pages/Instructor/LessonEditor.tsx` and `components/Lessons/LessonEditor.tsx` already have `courseId` available
- ℹ️ Immediate upload is acceptable for editing existing lessons (course already exists)
- ℹ️ Only CourseCreationForm needed deferred upload (files uploaded before course exists)

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Backend rebuilt with updated upload.ts (port 3001)
- ✅ Frontend running with deferred upload (port 5173)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Database schema aligned
- ✅ CORS configured correctly
- ✅ All accessibility warnings resolved

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE

### Port Configuration (NEVER CHANGE)
- **Backend Server**: ALWAYS port 3001
- **Frontend Client**: ALWAYS port 5173
- **CORS Configuration**: Backend configured for http://localhost:5173
- **NEVER** move or suggest moving to different ports (5174, 5175, etc.)
- **If port in use**: Kill the conflicting process, DO NOT change port numbers
- **Reason**: Port changes cause CORS mismatches and API connection failures

### Starting Servers
```bash
# ALWAYS kill all node processes first if ports are in use
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Start backend on 3001
cd D:\exampleProjects\startupexample1\server
npm run dev

# Start frontend on 5173
cd D:\exampleProjects\startupexample1\client
npm run dev
```
