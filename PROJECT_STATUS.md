## 💡 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Field Naming**: Backend uses camelCase in API responses (not PascalCase from database)
2. **Assessment Preview**: Uses `IsPreview` database field to separate analytics
3. **Course Integration**: Hybrid approach - real API data with fallback UI structure
4. **License Choice**: Proprietary license for IP protection
5. **Property Name Handling**: Systematic approach to handle database capitalized fields vs frontend lowercase expectations
6. **Instructor Detection**: Enhanced enrollment API to distinguish instructors from students for proper UI display
7. **Database Safety Protocol**: After October 25, 2025 incident, established mandatory safety rules in DATABASE_SAFETY_RULES.md - MUST be reviewed before ANY database operations
